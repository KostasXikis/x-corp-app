# [X-CORP](https://www.x-corp.systems) eHealth App

Part of [eHealth Services](https://www.ds.unipi.gr/en/courses/e-health-services-2/) Semester Project 2020

## What is it

It is a web-based platform that helps with the management of radiological procedures of health districts.
Doctors, Radiologists and Actinology Center admins have the ability to register on the platform and start managing X-ray exams.

## What problem does this solve

Actinology centers can use this platform to assign X-ray exams to the right radiologists at the right time, based on **availability** and **exam priority**. This saves valuable **time** for patients and resources for hospitals.

## What does it do

* A **Doctor** makes a radiology request for a patient.  
* The **Actinology Center** admin sees the doctor's radiology request and then needs to set an appointment for the patient.  
The problem is **which radiologist should be assigned the appointment**.  
The app recommends the right radiologist(s) based on:  
  * **Radiologist Availability**.
  * **Number of appointments each radiologist has**.
  * **Exam priority** (that has been set by the doctor).  
* The radiologist is assigned the appointment and completes the X-ray exam.
