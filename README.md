# X-CORP eHealth App

Part of [eHealth Services](https://www.ds.unipi.gr/en/courses/e-health-services-2/) Semester Project 2020

## What is it?

It is a web-based platform that helps with the management of radiological procedures of health districts.
Doctors, Radiologists and Actinology Center Admins have the ability to register on the platform and start managing X-ray exams.

## What problem does this solve?

Actinology centres can use this platform to assign X-ray exams to the right radiologists at the right time, based on **availability** and **exam priority**. This saves valuable **time** for patients and resources for hospitals.
