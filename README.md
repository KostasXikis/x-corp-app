# Health Web Apps | Semester Project 2020

A web-based platform to help with the management of radiological procedures of health districts.
Doctors, Radiologists and Actinology Center Admins have the ability to register on the platform and start managing X-ray exams.

## What problem does this solve?
Actinology centres can use this platform to assign X-ray exams to the right radiologists at the right time, based on **availability** and **exam priority**. This saves valuable time for patients and resources for hospitals.
